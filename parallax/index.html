            <p>Thankyou for showing interest, here is a quick story of me and this website. My programming journey started back in 2019, few months before I started studying CSE in LNCT Bhopal. I am currently in my second year and doing Technical Content Writing Internship at GeeksForGeeks. I like coding all kind of problems from the very basic like adding numbers to the complex ones like competitive programming problems. I love making projects and games. Infact this website is one of my Web Development Projects which is built using HTML and CSS.
